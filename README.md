# To Do List
A Java "to-do list" application is my individual project built on 17 Sep 2018, during my attendance to a course in Software development academy. 
It was developed for training purposes only!!!.

Its working by the console and let you add, remove, mark as done a task which contain title, due date, status and project, you have also possibility to display you tasks by date or project.
